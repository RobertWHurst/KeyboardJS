## Description ##

**TangibleKeyboard** is a a flexible and easy to use keyboard binding library allowing the user to attach events to key presses and key combinations. It is a spin-off of the nice `KeyboardJS` library created by <a href="https://github.com/RobertWHurst/KeyboardJS">Robert Hurst</a>.

In particular this version adds layouts for various keyboard emulators often used in physical computing to gather input from switches. It also adds explicit support for key repeat prevention. This means you can, if you so wish, ignore repeated `keydown` events sent by the OS when a key is being held down. This version also allows you to specify whether browser actions tied to certain key combinations should be triggered or not (`preventDefault`).
